This part is explaining the autocompletion mechanism for creating the
compliance links and establishing the compliance framework.

### Getting Started

The Compliance folder is added to DOORS in the addins directory in
TELELOGIC\_HOME\\DOORS \_8.0\\lib\\dxl\\. Inside this folder, two files
are provided, Compliance.hlp and Compliance.idx.

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compliance.hlp | A Help file describing the library |
| Compliance.idx | A file to build the menu item visible within DOORS |

The modification that should be done is based on the type of the UCM model associate with the GRL element.

Component definition: All references to this definition should be visible or not Responsability definition: All references to this definition should be visible or not. In the Map, shows empty point instead of responsability PathNode: Visible or not. Show empty point if not visible Map: An association with a map should be done through a stub (dynamic stub?)

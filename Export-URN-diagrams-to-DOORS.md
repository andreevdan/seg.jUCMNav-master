Click Finish. jUCMNav will then generate a DXL script (with bitmap
images) corresponding to your URN model.

## Running a DXL Script in DOORS (Importing a URN Model in DOORS)

URN models are imported from jUCMNav in a project in DOORS and for each
of the URN model, a new folder with the name of the URN model is
created.

Run the DXL script generated by jUCMNav in Telelogic DOORS to import the
URN model in DOORS.

In DOORS Database click on Tools -\> Edit DXL...

Click on Load... -\> Select the DXL script generated by jUCMNav.

\<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/load2.png" width="606" height="502" /\>

Click on Run. DOORS will create a folder or a project, whose name is
same as the selected DXL script, with ten formal modules and eight link
modules.

as seen in the top instruction.

In DOORS, click on Tools -\> Edit DXL...

The DXL Interaction window will then show up. Click on Load and then
choose the dxl file which was exported.

\<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/doorsloadupdate.PNG" width="605" height="505"

Click on Run. A message will be prompted saying "Found MATCHING URN
folder" and ask for update.

Click on Update. This will update the exising formal modules.

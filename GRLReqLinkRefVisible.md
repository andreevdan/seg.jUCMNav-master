In the properties of a link, we could have a visible attibute. If this attribute is set to false, the link will not be display.

To display a link that visible attribute have been set to false, we could have an option in the context menu for the intentional element to show the non-visible links (and maybe a dynamic menu who shows the non-visible links, and allow user to select which one to display).

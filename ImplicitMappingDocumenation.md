Implicit Mapping Documentation

As outlined in Yong Xiang Zeng’s thesis, implicit mappings are essential to creating a valid CSM file. These mappings are necessary since there exist some elements in CSM that have no equivalent in UCM. Despite this lack of equivalency, these elements still need to be somehow represented in CSM. The scope of this section of our report is to show which of these elements we have implemented and how we implemented them.

This section is divided into three parts: Requirements, Designer information, and Summary. The requirements subsection gives a summary of everything that needed to be implemented. The designer information will include our design options and choices, with the appropriate explanations. Finally, to further any future works on this topic, the summary will include a compilation of everything that has been implemented so far as well as everything that remains to be done or that should be done – given more time and resources.

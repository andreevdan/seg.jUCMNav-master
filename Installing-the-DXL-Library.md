# Installing the DXL Library

## Installation in DOORS 8.x

### Installing URN and Compliance tool in DOORS

In order to be able to import URN models built in jUCMNav in DOORS and/or be able to create automated compliance link in DOORS, it is necessary to install the URN tool. Get the URN tool from [URN-Compliance.zip](%ATTACHURL%/URN-Compliance.zip) and extract the URN.zip to the **Program Files\Telelogic\DOORS_8.3\lib\dxl\addins** directory (or in 8.2 if you are using an older version of DOORS).

_Note_: Make sure that the folders **URN** and *Compliance* exist in the **C:\Program Files\Telelogic\DOORS_8.3\lib\dxl\addins** directory. If they are in the **..\addins\URN-Compliance** directory, then move them up to the **..\addins** directory and delete the URN-Compliance directory.

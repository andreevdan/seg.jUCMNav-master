This is too general to actually have an idea of what you exactly want. hide all views or completely hide every window except the editor? if only the editor remains, the navigation must be integrated with the editor...

If you double click on the top of an editor tab, all view are hidden and only the editor remain visible... But the menus at the top are still visible.

Ideally, this would be like a Power Point? presentation where the navigation could be done with the mouse or keyboard. As for the edition, having transofmration-based pop-up menus instead of relying solely on drag-and-drop tools could help.

That's the right way to do it. True full-screen (by hiding common Eclipse Workspace elements) really breaks workbench interaction standards. I, for one, don't want to allow this. (why is it approved??)

Ok.

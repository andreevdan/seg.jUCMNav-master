Would like to propose a change to: Req Elem Start Point Attributes

Workload is not yet in model; performance annotations.

Would like to remove this from the description. Would drop test Test Req Elem Start Point Attributes 1?, other items in description are tested by Test Req Elem Empty Point 1?

workload is in model, see GRL; implementation required; to be used as exampel for future developers.

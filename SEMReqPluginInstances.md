This requirements needs further discussions. Somehow it should be possible to define whether two or more stubs share the same instance of a plug-in map or not. What is the default behavior? Should we define singleton plug-in maps (which are therefore shared by all stubs)? Should we define groups of stubs that share the same plug-in map? Is this too complicated? How does this conflict with component instances?

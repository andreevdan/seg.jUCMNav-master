You mean that, in the future, you will be able to create and modify (basically do ANYTHING/EVERYTHING) via the keyboard? Or simply that you will want shortcut keys for common operations such as DEL for delete? -- Jason Kealey - 03 Feb 2005

Not EVERYTHING (of course, I don't want to use the keyboard to start moving points and curves around in a UCM path), but the common shortcuts should be there (save, open, print, page up/down, arrow keys, shift-click for muliple selection, DEL, etc)... essentially the main menu items. I suppose there exist Eclipse UI guidelines for this as well. -- Daniel Amyot - 13 Feb 2005

Moving to future for uniformity. -- Jason Kealey - 17 Feb 2005

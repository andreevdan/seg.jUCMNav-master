At this point, AoUCM support may be restricted to the composed system. This requires a single plug-in binding to connect not only one stub to one plug-in map but **many** stubs to one plug-in map. This requires changes to the plug-in binding UI.

In the future, the traversal of AoUCM should take the information in joinpoints into account (effectively weaving the aspects into the system during traversal). This, however, is orthogonal to clarifying the semantics of UCMs.

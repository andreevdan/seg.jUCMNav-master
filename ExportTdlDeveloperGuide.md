# Export toTDL - Coding Documentation

Mapping from UCM models to the TDL representation is the process of
detecting the elements that have the same concepts between the two
different models. The elements that are detected in the mapping process
are divided into two groups: elements having explicit mappings and
elements having implicit mapping. In the sections below, we will discuss
in more details the implicit and explicit mappings.

## Mappping Documention For TDL Export

There are some elements in the UCM Scenarios and TDL models which have
one-to-one mapping relationship (i.e. direct relationship). In this
section we will outline the **Requirements**, **Design information** and
**Testing** for explicit mapping. And we will finish it off with the
**Summary** for explicit mapping. The requirements subsection provides a
summary of everything that needs to be implemented. The designer
information subsection explains the choices and options we considered
from designerâ€™s point of view. Finally, testing part will outline the
methods we used to test explicit mapping cases.

Your main goal here is to be able to quickly print all diagrams in a ucm file. However, I want you to define exactly what you want here. Do you want the diagram to be resized to fit on a page, spread out on multiple pages, etc. This seems to be a lot of work and can be temporarily replaced by a mass export to JPG files which can then be batch printed. You also wanted reports. An HTML report could be generated with full sized images and it would simplify our work. Fulfilling this requirement would require a print preview page, which is of lower priority.

I would like to put this requirement outside of the scope of our project.

Mapping from UCM models to the CSM representation is the process of detecting the elements that have the same concepts between the two different models. The elements that are detected in the mapping process are divided into two groups: elements having explicit mappings and elements having implicit mapping. In the sections below, we will discuss in more details the implicit and explicit mappings.

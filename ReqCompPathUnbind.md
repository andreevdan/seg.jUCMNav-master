I cannot find the option. Please be more specific. I want to study its behaviour. I found it for components but not paths.

Right-click on a component, select "Unbind Enclosed Path Elements". You can then move the component while the path elements stay where they are (because they are not bound to the component anymore). You can then select "Bind Enclosed Path Elements" if desired (to re-bind the enclosed elements).

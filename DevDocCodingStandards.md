# Coding Standards

## Changes

  - More characters per line before wrapping; great for 1600x1200, not
    so great for printing, but who prints the code anyways?
  - Less spacing between class members
  - Rest should be pretty much the standard template; I don't remember
    changing anything else.

## Installation

  - Window --\> Preferences; Java --\> Code Style --\> Code Formatter
  - Import the attached file.

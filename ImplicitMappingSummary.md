IMPLICIT MAPPING SUMMARY

The following is a summary of the Implicit Mapping material.

What has been done

1\. The Resource Acquisition and Release algorithms have been
implemented and, given the above test cases, function as required.

2\. RA, RR, Sequence and Dummy Steps are displayed in the CSM file and
have been Xerces-approved.

What needs to be done

1\. Find a better ID naming convention, to accommodate a larger number
of insertions.

2\. Find a way to improve the testing process:

Construct a tool to build random maps in the UCM Navigator and convert
them to CSM. Create a bug-reporting repository to store all the known
bugs in the program. This repository should be accessible to all members
of the team.

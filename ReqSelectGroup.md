network editor already does this. -- Jason Kealey - 03 Feb 2005

Just a little question... Right now when you select multiple object in network editor with the marquee tool, you have to enclose COMPLETELY the figures you want to select or they're not selected. Do we let this like that or select a figure even if it's not completely surrounded by the marquee tool?

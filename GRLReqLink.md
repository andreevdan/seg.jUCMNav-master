I think we should support only 3 types of links: Decomposition, contributions and dependencies. Decomposition could be used instead of mean-ends. Also, the AND-OR link could be include in decomposition instead of contributions.

For the correlation, I think we should include it in the contributions. The effect that it has on element is the same.

How should we deleted the links? Maybe we should add an option in the context menu where we can choose between delete reference and delete definition (delete reference only delete the selected reference and delete definition delete the definition and all the references).

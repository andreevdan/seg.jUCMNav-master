# Abstract
Once aspects have been identified during requirements engineering activities, the behaviour, structure, and pointcut expressions of aspects need to be modeled unobtrusively at the requirements level, allowing the engineer to seamlessly focus either on the behaviour and structure of the system without aspects or the combined behaviour and structure. Furthermore, the modeling techniques for aspects should be the _same_ as for the base system, ensuring that the engineer continues to work with familiar models. This paper describes how, with the help of Use Case Maps, scenario-based aspects can be modeled at the requirements level unobtrusively and with the same techniques as for non-aspectual systems. Use Case Maps are a visual scenario notation under standardization by the International Telecommunication Union. With Use Case Maps, aspects as well as pointcut expressions are modeled in a visual way which is generally considered the preferred choice for models of a high level of abstraction.

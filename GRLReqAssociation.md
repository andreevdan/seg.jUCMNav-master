I think the elements in GRL that could make associations between GRL and UCM are resources and tasks. They are concrete elements that are used to operationalize the goals.

I think the association between resources and UCM elements should be with component definition.

Also, I think the GRL tasks could be associate to any UCM elements (except responsability references and component references in the metamodel): a responsability, a component, a pathnode or a UCMmap.

## Core Scenario Model

The Core Scenario Model (CSM) is an intermediate format between various
source scenario notations (UCM, UML, etc.) annotated with performance
information, and target performance languages
([LQN](http://www.layeredqueues.org), Petri Nets, stochastic process
algebras, etc.). It is being developed in collaboration with the
[PUMA](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/rads/puma/) project at Carleton
University.

  - The maintainer is Dorin Petriu (<dorin@sce.carleton.ca>).
  - The Performance package of the URNMetaModel is quite in line with
    CSM.
  - See also the CsmExport plug-in for jUCMNav.

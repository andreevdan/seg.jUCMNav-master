Moved from Low to Medium. This is actually a feature of Rose we think to take advantage of in another project. This is not useless...

Don't see a problem with this. This is done with edit policies using the SELECTION_FEEDBACK_ROLE. From the GEF documentation:

"This role is a feedback only. The Selection Tool? will send two types of requests to parts as the mouse enters and pauses over objects. Edit Policies? implementing this role may alter the Edit Part?'s view in some way, or popup hints and labels and the like."

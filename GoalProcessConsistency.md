# Goal/Process Consistency and Alignment Analysis Project

The URN standard does not provide means of checking consistency between
the GRL and UCM views of a model, leading to models that are potentially
erroneous. This project aims to develop a set of rules for checking
common consistency properties in URN models. These rules are implemented
as user-selectable OCL constraints in the jUCMNav tool.

These rules complement existing rules [(Predefined Semantics Rules Overview)](PredefinedSemanticsRulesOverview)
as part of jUCMNav's general support for [Semantic Verification](SemanticVerification).

Use the metadata *Traces=No* on model elements for which the rules
should not apply.

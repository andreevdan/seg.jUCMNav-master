I think the belief should be associate only to one grl diagram (comparing to actors and intentional elements that could have multiple references in the diagrams). I also removed the evaluation level from the beliefs because it was hard to use, and with the evaluation set that we will create, the modification of a link contribution will not be necessary (only need to create a new evaluation set instead). Belief should be use only as comments in the diagrams.

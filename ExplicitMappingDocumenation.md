# Explicit mapping Documenation

There are some elements in the UCM and CSM models which have one-to-one mapping relationship (i.e. direct relationship). In this section we will outline the Requirements, Design information and Testing for explicit mapping. And we will finish it off with the Summary for explicit mapping. The requirements subsection provides a **summary** of everything that needed to be implemented. The designer information subsection explains the choices and options we considered from designerâ€™s point of view. Finally, testing part will outline the methods we used to test explicit mapping cases.

   * Already implemented basic behaviour
   * Must insure that its intended interactions are possible with other elements
   * For example: Insert other elements to replace the empty node, etc. 



See [Change Req Empty Point Occurence](ChangeReqEmptyPointOccurence): removing third bullet. 

For completion, no longer have to allow intended interactions. That is the responsibility of the new elements. 

Therefore is implemented.

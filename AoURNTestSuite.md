# Aspect-oriented User Requirements Notation (!AoURN) Test Suite
The complete test suite can be downloaded as a [zip files](att/AoURN_Tests_201009141132.zip). The test suite contains a series of jucm files which typically contain a base map, an aspect map, and a pointcut map. The test is run by right-clicking on the background of the aspect map and selecting "Apply Concern". The expected test results are also indicated on the aspect map.

The table below shows the name of the jucm file in the first column. The second column shows the name of the aspect map. As some jucm files may contain more than one test case, more than one name may be shown in this column for one jucm file. The third column indicates the result of the test case.

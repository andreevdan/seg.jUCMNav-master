# Integrating jUCMNav with DOORS

Description: Telelogic DOORS is a requirements management system (RMS)
which is used to collect, organize and link requirements in a database
to improve collaboration and communication between various stakeholders.
Telelogic DOORS uses links to represent relationships between
requirements. These links help to analyze the impact of change and
monitor the level of conformance to the stakeholdersâ€™ needs.

jUCMNav uses DXL (DOORS Extension Laguage) scripts and custom libraries
to support exporting DOORS modules including UCM diagrams, GRL diagrams,
requirements objects (e.g., actors, intentional elements,
responsibilities, components, stubs) along with their attributes, and
even the links describing internal or user-defined relationships between
URN elements. Multiple views in DOORS are created to support the
visualization of changes as linked URN models and external requirements
evolve.

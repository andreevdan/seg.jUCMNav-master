Just wanted to try this form with something simple... .ucm are really for UCMNav. Not to confuse things, I propose .jucm for jUCMNav files. When the URN XML schema becomes available, this XML representation could have the .urn extension.

Will have to drop stubs if you want this done on time. smile Approximate bloated time to fix, test and make sure everything works with deployment for this change request: 1h. Accepted. Note that this is not for Req File Association but is for the extension specified in plugin.xml -- Jason Kealey - 18 Mar 2005

i've implemented the code. i won't remove the ucm extension yet. I'll leave both active

Stubs can wait smile

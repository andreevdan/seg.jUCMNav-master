# Project DA-8: Automatic Layout for Use Case Maps

Use Case Maps contain scenario paths (splines) superimposed on a
structure of components (usually rectangles). UCMNav supports the
creation and editing of UCM models, however, it has no auto-layout
mechanism. Such a mechanism is essential in a context where UCM models
are reverse-engineered from existing software or designs. This project
targets the creation of a tool (integrated to UCMNav or as a stand-alone
tool) that would add the layout information to a UCM model. Existing
tools such as GraphViz could be integrated to this tool, or else
specific layout algorithms could be created. This project requires
knowledge of XML and of parsing technologies/tools in general.

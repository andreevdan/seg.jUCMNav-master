## jUCMNav Flash Demos

Instead of describing the tool's behaviour textually, we have created a
few demonstrations to allow newcomers to quickly grasp what the tool
actually does. These demonstrations are available either as annotated
Flash videos or as YouTube videos.

### jUCMNav's Report Generation Tool

This series of videos created by Alexandre Hamel and Jean-François
Séguin shows how to create reports using jUCMNav's report generation
tool. Some of these videos also show how to customize these reports
(using jUCMNav's preferences) and navigate through the various pages of
HTML reports (2012).

  - [Using jUCMNav's report generation
    tool](UsingJUCMNavSReportGenerationTool).

    preferences](SettingUCMandGRLPreferences).
  - [Setting scenario-related preferences](SettingScenarioPreferences).
  - [Setting GRL strategy preferences](GRLStrategyPreferences).
  - [Browsing in an HTML report](BrowsingHTMLReports).

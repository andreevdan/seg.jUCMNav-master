Do we really need criticality and priority for intentional elements? Could we combined these 2 attributes into 1 because if not, we need to take these 2 attributes in consideration when we will calculte the evaluation level.

Priority and criticality should be divided as 2 attributes. Instead of using it in the evaluation level, we could give feedback to the user on elements with high priority or criticality and low evaluation level.

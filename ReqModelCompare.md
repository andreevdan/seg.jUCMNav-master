That's easy to say. It's already a hard problem for plain text files; have fun doing it with your graphical notation smile

Maybe add some sort of unique ID in the different parts of the model would help do the comparison between two version of the same model? That way you can match model from the two version by their unique ID and just show the differences. New parts in a newer version would easilly be identified this way too.

We would probably have to think of a better algorithm to compare to completely different UCM for similarities/differences.

This should be done for some elements of the metamodel only, not everything (some modifications are not significant). Not within the scope of your project!

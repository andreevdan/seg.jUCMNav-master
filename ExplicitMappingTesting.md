# EXPLICIT MAPPING TESTING

**Acceptance Testing**

For acceptance testing, weâ€™ve created different test maps (see appendix D) that cover all the directly mapped elements. Once the test map is converted, we check the output to see if the values corresponding to CSM tags and attributes are accurate.

**CSM-compliancy Testing**

In order to check whether our results are CSM-compliant, we validated the resulting CSM files against the XML Schema. To do this we used Apache Xerces [1].

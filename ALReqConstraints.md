   * These constraints will be persisted in XML.
   * We will be able to manipulate these constraints in jUCMNav. 

To investigate: do we want to have to have a current constraint state in the system which we can replace in full with the one defined in a file or do we want to load files that add additional contraints and have the option to remove all constraints and start over if we change our minds?

This pattern is supported by allowing no conditions to be specified on all branches of an OR-fork or for all plug-ins of a stub. This is already possible but the traversal mechanism requires additional information at the OR-fork or stub in order to continue with the traversal. Therefore, the scenario definitions must be able to explicitly identify a branch of an OR-fork or plug-in of a stub in order to continue the traversal with the chosen branch or plug-in.

By supporting Deferred Choice, the pattern Milestone can also be supported.
